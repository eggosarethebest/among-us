ᴘʟᴀʏ ᴡɪᴛʜ ᴏᴛʜᴇʀ Players ᴀʟʟ ᴏᴠᴇʀ ᴛʜᴇ ᴡᴏʀʟᴅ!

This project is a recreation of the popular game Among Us! Create a room (or join an existing one) and play with up to 10 players online :)

The red button in the middle of the map calls an emergency meeting, so please don't randomly press it

➥ Key shortcuts:
[wasd] / [arrow keys] - move
[space] - use / vent (as impostor)
[r] - report body
[q] - kill (as impostor)

➥ How to play:
To start the game, the host clicks the "start" button.
At the beginning of a game, each player is either assigned the "Crewmate" or the "Impostor" role.

➥ Ending:
The game ends when
- all impostors are dead (victory for crew)
- the crew completes all tasks (victory for crew)
- there are as many impostors as crewmates (victory for impostors)
- the crew fails to fix a critical sabotage in time

➥ Visual tasks:
If someone completes a visual task, the other players will be able to see that.
These visual tasks currently exist in the game:
- Prime Shields
- Submit Scan

➥ Sabotages:
Reactor: Two people have to press the hand on the different spots.
O2: The code has to be entered on both spots.
Lights: All switches have to be turned so that all lights are green.

➥ Disclaimer:
It is NOT allowed to join the same room multiple times, that is considered as cheating. If you someone is playing unfair, please let me know in comments
